The best thing about Google is there is something new to learn every day. I would like to contribute to Africa by mitigating natural disasters using AI/machine learning. If we know ahead of time, that some natural disasters can happen, we can minimize the damage they can cause. One good example is Google's flood forecasting initiative.

A2SV helped me by providing well-structured coursework to pass technical and behavioral interviews. The coursework included competitive programming, mock interviews, accent reduction, communication skills, etc. All of these are very essential to crack interviews at tech companies."
